Internet Churn Rate Prediction

Introduction
The Internet Churn Rate Prediction application is designed to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, the application helps Internet Service Providers (ISPs) identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain these customers.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw customer data for analysis.
Model Training: Train machine learning models to predict churn.
Prediction: Predict churn probabilities for new or existing customers.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using various metrics.
Dashboard: User-friendly interface to visualize data, predictions, and insights.


Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit (for web app)/

Setup
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/techvora/Internet_user_churn_predictor.git
cd internet-churn-prediction

Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebooks (if applicable):
jupyter notebook

Run the Streamlit App:
streamlit run app.py

Access the Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Usage
Data Preprocessing
Use the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to clean and preprocess the customer data.
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Model Training
The model_training.ipynb notebook demonstrates how to train machine learning models.
Train multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and select the best performing one.
Prediction
Use the trained model to predict churn probabilities for new or existing customers.
The Flask app provides a web interface to input customer data and get predictions.
Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Visualize evaluation results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
